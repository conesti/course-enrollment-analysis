# course-enrollment-analysis
This is an analysis on course enrollment sizes at Harvard.  The various tabs demonstrate different aspects of the data found on the Harvard Registrar online.

The app folder is named fall_course_enrollment_analysis because this was originally a project using only fall data.  I changed the url to reflect this change since it is front-facing, but the folder is connected to an rsconnect file which I do not want to tamper with.
